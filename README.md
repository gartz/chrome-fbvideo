Facebook start to officially create their implementation for the same functionality I implemented years ago: http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2015/07/07/watch-out-youtube/

I'm very proud that Facebook is implementing my idea for a better usability, I don't know if the responsables for this project know about my project or not, nobody ever contacted me. Really hope that users like the funcionality and if Facebook want more ideas, please contact me :)
